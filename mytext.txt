Now this is the second change on BranchA. Let's see if I can commit it.

I am now making some changes to this file. I'm now on branchA. I will make some changes in this file.

This is a text I'm doing to learn git. There will no longer be a lorem ipsum paragraph. Everything here will make sense.

The first version has a lorem ipsum in the first paragraph. This is the first version.

This paragraph is something I will be thinking about. I will change here a bit before comitting.

Now I did my first commit. I want to save again and see what happens.
